# oil-price-prediction
- Oil is a product that goes completely in a different direction for a single market event as the oil prices are rarely based on real-time data, instead, it is driven by externalities making our attempt to forecast it even more challenging. As the economy will be highly affected by oil prices our model will help to understand the pattern in prices to help the customers and businesses to make smart decisions.
- Used various algorithms such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet and LSTM.
- Deploy model using Streamlit, Flask.
